# Boston Airbnb Listings

The objective of this project was to create an interactive application that provides users with various information about AirBnB listings in the Boston area. The app allows users to filter listings by price range and room type, and choose different features they want to visualize on the map such as hospitals, police stations, bike stations, EV charging stations, and parking meters. In addition, the application provides an option to select and highlight different neighborhoods and public transit lines, allowing users to explore the city's infrastructure in relation to the AirBnB listings.

The [Shiny app](https://connoraking.shinyapps.io/boston_listings_app/) was hosted on shinyapps.io

In the course of this project, I've applied extensive use of various R libraries:

- `Plotly`: A tool for creating interactive plots. It was used for both map layers and the boxplot visualization of the distribution of Airbnb listing prices across different neighborhoods.
-
